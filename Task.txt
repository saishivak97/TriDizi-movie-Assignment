1: Write Backend API Using Express in Node.js

Set Up the Project:
* Initialize a new Node.js project.
* Install required dependencies (express, axios, cors).

Create the Express Server:

* Set up the basic Express server.
* Enable CORS for cross-origin requests.

Create API Endpoints:

* Define a route to fetch movies data from the TMDB API.
* Parse and send the relevant movie data (name, main actors, director) to the frontend.

Handle Errors:

* Implement error handling for API requests and responses.

2: Get Movies Data from TMDB Website and Show It in the Front End 

TMDB API Integration:
* Register for an API key on the TMDB website.
* Read TMDB API documentation to understand endpoints for fetching movie details.

Fetch Movies Data:

* Use axios or similar to make HTTP requests to TMDB API.
* Fetch movie details including images, names, main actors, and directors.

Send Data to Frontend:

* Send the fetched movies data from the backend to the frontend via API endpoints.

3: Display Movie Data on Frontend

Set Up Frontend Framework:

* Choose a frontend framework/library (React, Angular, or Vue).

Create UI Components:

* Create components for displaying movie images.
* Create components for displaying movie details (name, main actors, director).

Fetch Data from Backend:

* Use fetch or axios to make requests to the backend API.
* Handle the response data and update the UI.

Style the Components:

* Apply CSS to style the movie images and details.
* Handle User Interactions:

Implement any necessary user interactions, such as clicking on a movie to see more details.
By following these points, you can build a complete application that fetches movie data from TMDB and displays it on the frontend with the required details.
